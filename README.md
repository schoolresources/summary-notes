# Summary Notes

This is a repository of summary notes for various subjects (mainly maths for now). Each of the folders contains a PDF of the summary notes, as well as the original `.tex` file and any other assets, so you can compile the PDF and add to it as you wish.

Currently, notes for the following subjects are available:
- 11 Specialist Mathematics (SACE)
- 12 Specialist Mathematics (SACE)
- 12 Mathematical Methods (SACE)
